email her:
Time frame.
Schedule a meeting before the final hand in.
	
A email of our idea of how the %40 is split up. So that she can confirm.


her recommendations our site
contact information is good but the email and name isn't always as much.
There is a field called referral which is more vital and accurate. because some organizations are run by other orgs. So the referral is to the owner org.

Stuff in db but not website:
rgi
we should also look for ourselves which ones aren't accessible on the website


IDEA for hers
Using the address to see which area of town that is in. and have it in the search criteria (Search by the area)

A big goal of ours is even to basically present the data in the current map site in a better format. both an exportable format and more bulk mindset ind of results

There is a relationship between organizations of which organizations own/controil other organizations 

exportability is really big.


look through db find bad data columns. make a list. and think about what rich reports we could design if we had good data. email her a list of those columns and explanations of rich reports. Then she will confirm whether or not we should do mock data.
