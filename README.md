In this project, my team and I have developed a prototype of a live site 'iSearch Kelowna' which is a non-profit site that allows individuals or groups to search and find housing based on criteria that are input into the site. We developed a prototype that generates a set of reports from data inside the site and created specifically for separate user groups. Our job was to help group of users who are looking to pull out information that helps to create data relative to service providers. In the past, there was no way to capture information about the housing sector in Kelowna and no way for an individual agency to compare the services that they offer relative to other organizations.
